=head1 NAME

SQL::Translator::Producer::DiaUml -
    Produces dia UML diagrams from schema.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use SQL::Translator;
  my $translator     = SQL::Translator->new(
      from           => 'MySQL',
      filename       => 'foo_schema.sql',
      to             => 'DiaUml',
  );
  print $translator->translate;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Currently you will get one class (with the a table
stereotype) generated per table in the schema. The fields are added as
attributes of the classes and their datatypes set. It doesn't currently set any
of the relationships. It doesn't do any layout, all the classes are in one big
stack. However it is still useful as you can use the layout tools in Dia to
automatically arrange them horizontally or vertically.
