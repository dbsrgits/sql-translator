* Major cleanup of GraphViz proucer
* Massive amount of fixes to SQLite/Pg/Mysql/MSSQL parsers/producers
  Fix most of the problems uncovered by the roundtrip test framework
  Some highlights:
    - Rewind exhausted globs before attempting a read
    - Do not add xml comment header if no_comments is set
    - table/field counts are held per schema object, not globally
    - no more variable table and column names in SQLite and MSSQL
    - VIEW support for Pg parser, also some cleanups
    - The way we generate Pg create view statements was not standards compliant
      (per RhodiumToad in #postgresql)
    - Disable MSSQL view/procedure production - they never worked in the first place
    - SQLite/MSSQL improvements:
      - Support parsing of all DROP clauses
      - Support parsing of field-level comments
      - When producing do not append table names to constraint/index names

  Producer (ribasushi)

  producer (wreis)
* Removed source_db and target_db accessors from Diff (throwback to old version,

* Major refactoring of SQL::Translator::Diff again:
* Diff is no longer one huge monolithic function.                         
* Added more tests for diff                                               
* When producing diffs for MySQL you will (by default) get single alter 
  statements per table
* SQLite can also do remove columns (by creating a temp table as shown in 
  http://sqlite.org/faq.html#q11
* Columns can be renamed if the new schema is from a form that can have metadata
  (which is pretty much anything but an SQL file.) It does this by looking at 
  renamed_from in the $field->extra                              
* Updated Oracle and Postgres producers
* More tests!

# -----------------------------------------------------------
# 0.0899_01 2007-10-21
# ----------------------------------------------------------

* SQL::Translator::Diff now uses the ::Producer modules to create diffs
  This *will* break back-compatibility

    class for all Schema objects.
