!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
*** INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES:
* SQLT no longer supports setting separate conflicting values for the now
  deprecated 'quote_table_names' and 'quote_field_names'. Instead their values
  are proxied to the new 'quote_identifiers'. If 'quote_identifiers' is
  supplied, the legacy settings are ignored (with a warning). If nothing is
  specified the default is TRUE as before. If only one is specified - default
  to its value for everything, and if both are specified with a conflicting
  value an exception is thrown.
* Partial quoting support has been added in SQLite. It is currently disabled by
  default, you need to request is explicitly with quote_identifiers => 1. In a
  future version of SQL::Translator *THIS DEFAULT BEHAVIOR WILL CHANGE*.
  If you do NOT WANT quoting, set quote_identifiers to a false value to
  protect yourself from changes in a future release.
* Bump the default MySQL parser version to MySQL 4.0

    - table/field counts are held per schema object, not globally
    - no more variable table and column names in SQLite and MSSQL

    - The way we generate Pg create view statements was not standards compliant
      (per RhodiumToad in #postgresql)
    - Disable MSSQL view/procedure production - they never worked in the first place
    - SQLite/MSSQL improvements:
      - Support parsing of all DROP clauses
      - Support parsing of field-level comments
      - When producing do not append table names to constraint/index names

* Major refactoring of SQL::Translator::Diff again:
* Diff is no longer one huge monolithic function.
* Added more tests for diff
* When producing diffs for MySQL you will (by default) get single alter
  statements per table
* SQLite can also do remove columns (by creating a temp table as shown in
  http://sqlite.org/faq.html#q11
* Columns can be renamed if the new schema is from a form that can have metadata
  (which is pretty much anything but an SQL file.) It does this by looking at
  renamed_from in the $field->extra
