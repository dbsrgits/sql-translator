[ INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES ]

 * SQLT no longer supports setting separate conflicting values for the now
   deprecated 'quote_table_names' and 'quote_field_names'. Instead their values
   are proxied to the new 'quote_identifiers'. If 'quote_identifiers' is
   supplied, the legacy settings are ignored (with a warning). If nothing is
   specified the default is TRUE as before. If only one is specified - default
   to its value for everything, and if both are specified with a conflicting
   value an exception is thrown.

 * Partial quoting support has been added in SQLite. It is currently disabled by
   default, you need to request is explicitly with quote_identifiers => 1. In a
   future version of SQL::Translator *THIS DEFAULT BEHAVIOR WILL CHANGE*.
   If you do NOT WANT quoting, set quote_identifiers to a false value to
   protect yourself from changes in a future release.

 * Bump the default MySQL parser version to MySQL 4.0

 * Added more tests for diff

   http://sqlite.org/faq.html#q11
